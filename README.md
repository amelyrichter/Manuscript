# Uni Project 01 â€“ Typography and Interaction.
This is the first project in our coding and typography class. It was done by Amely Richter (me) in September 2024.
It is referencing the article "The Cult of the ugly" written by Steven Heller in 1933.
Here is the link to the article: https://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/cult-of-the-ugly
It is Amelys visual interpretation of Hellers words and and topics in the article.
